# Homeboard

The goal of this application is to learn more about React, and also to broaden my digital life.
While my life is already digital to an extend, I believe that I can take it to a whole other 
level with this application. The purpose of Homeboard is to move most of my daily chores to a
network of smart devices. A variety of devices will display or otherwise be connected to it,
all with their own use cases.
